- Focus on long-term goals

### 2. Lack of Diversification
- Don't put all money in one stock

- Regular investing beats trying to find perfect entry points
- Stay consistent with your strategy

### 4. Ignoring Fees
- Even small fees compound over time
- Compare expense ratios on funds
- Understand all costs involved
- Choose low-cost options when possible

## Tax Considerations

### Taxable vs. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
